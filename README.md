# SuiteScript API
**IDE friendly NetSuite Documentation** 


A lot of this information can be found around the internet,
but it's hard to find it all in any single location or format.

This resource aims to be a better place for up to date API docs as
each bi-annual update of SuiteScript tends to include a few 
small changes of function signatures. 


Pull requests welcome.
